###COINS

###D8 PERSONALITY TRAIT###
    #1 My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.
    #2 I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.
    #3 I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.
    #4 I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.
    #5 To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.
    #6 I never pass up a friendly wager.
    #7 My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.
    #8 I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.
###D6 IDEAL###
    #1 Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good)
    #2 Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)
    #3 Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)
    #4 Mastery. I’m a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)
    #5 People. I’m committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)
    #6 Aspiration. Someday I’ll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)
###D6 BOND###
    #1 I’m loyal to my captain first, everything else second.
    #2 The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.
    #3 I’ll always remember my first ship.
    #4 In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.
    #5 I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.
    #6 Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine.
###D6 FLAW###
    #1 I follow orders, even if I think they’re wrong.
    #2 I’ll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.
    #3 Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.
    #4 Once I start drinking, it’s hard for me to stop.
    #5 I can’t help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.
    #6 My pride will probably lead to my destruction.
