character creation and stuff

I created this repository when my computer died (like very very dead) and I thought I had to start over on all my code because I thought I didn't put it on git...well, as of 2/28/2017 I realized that my old stuff IS on here and it's better written and planned out and stuff, so...yeah...

Look at RPGcharacterSheet instead.

Keeping this up because I was heading somewhere with this, so I want to compare later.
